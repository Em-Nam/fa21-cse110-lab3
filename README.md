Practice with HTML by creating fake meeting minutes.
Traditionally, a meeting note includes:

- a title (e.g. "Pomodoro Timer First Brainstorm")
- subtitle for the meeting section/the topic of the meeting (e.g. "brainstorming", "check-ins", "documentation")
- subtitle for the date
- attendance list
- agenda of what the meeting will cover
- things that were unfinished business from last meeting
- things that are new business that need to be talked about
- any miscellaneous comments / questions / concerns that anyone would like to bring up
- pictures of any diagrams / architecture / things that were presented
- audio recording the meeting
- video recording of the meeting
